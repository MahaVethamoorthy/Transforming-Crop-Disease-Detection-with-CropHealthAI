# Transforming Crop Disease Detection with CropHealthAI
An automated system is being developed to detect leaf diseases and suggest appropriate treatments by leveraging machine learning and image processing techniques. Agricultural productivity often suffers due to plant diseases, resulting in significant economic losses. The system addresses this issue by allowing users, primarily farmers, to upload images of plant leaves. OpenCV is utilized for image preprocessing, while a neural network built with Keras and TensorFlow handles disease classification. After analyzing the uploaded images, the system detects the presence of diseases and provides diagnosis and treatment recommendations. A graphical user interface (GUI) is created using Tkinter for desktop applications, complemented by a web-based platform developed with Flask to enhance accessibility. The aim is to improve crop yield by delivering a fast, reliable, and accessible solution for plant disease identification.
